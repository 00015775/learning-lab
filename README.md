# Learning Lab

This repository is a personal learning lab for exploring and practicing different libraries, packages, frameworks, and projects.

## Repository Structure

- Each top-level folder is named after the library, package, framework, or project being learned.
- Inside each project folder:
  - `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)
  - `scripts/` → Python scripts (`.py`)
  - Environment files for reproducibility, such as:
    - `project-name-environment.yml`
    - `project-name-requirements.txt`
    - or other relevant setup files
  - A small `README.md` describing the specific project, goals, and notes

## Purpose

- Hands-on experimentation
- Learning by building small projects
- Keeping notes, code, and environments organized and reproducible


This repository is continuously evolving as new tools and concepts are explored.
